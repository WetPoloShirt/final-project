## Instructions
### Part I (Database Design)
  - Everyone will be required to submit an ERD for a database they have created and the accompanying SQL script to create the Database.
  - Lucidchart is to be used to create the ERD
  - One table must contain at least 100 records.
  - There must be at least five tables.
  - Normalization is to be used.
  - ERD link, ERD screenshot, and SQL code used to create the Database are to be uploaded to GitHub, and a link to your GitHub will be provided to the class on Moodle under Project discussion and Discord.
  - Individual or Teamwork work is allowed on this part, but everyone must submit a different ERD and associated SQL script. For example, Luke creates a database for College Course Enrollment, and Bob establishes a database for Real Estate. Luke and Bob can help each other. Luke and Bob could also create a database on the same topic, but record information and database structure will vary in that event. There is no cap on team size, but the class as a whole must have at least four different database topics.<hr>
### PART II (Connecting to the Database and performing CRUD operations.) 

- Use these four backend environments, programming languages and frameworks to connect to your relational Database and run database CRUD operations.
    - Node.js (JavaScript)
    - Django (Python)
    - PHP
    - Spring Boot (Java)
- Sharing code is encouraged on this part and having the same backend code is acceptable. Feel free to use code available on the internet as long as it is open source and you include the open source license on your GitHub. All students will at least have the MIT license on their GitHub repository related to this project. Help each other out.
- Upload all related code to GitHub and provide screenshots for each CRUD operation on GitHub.
  <hr>
### Part III (Deploy to the Cloud)
- Deploy your relational Database to the Cloud using only one backend choice from Part II
  - **Do not store the database username and password on GitHub!!!**
- Deploy for Free or Very Low cost. Some cloud providers may require a credit card. Make sure you understand the cost structure of whatever cloud service you choose. There are many articles online about how to do this for free. I have had success with Heroku. However, others have done it on AWS for free. Be mindful and shut the cloud service down when you are not using it to avoid unnecessary costs.
- Connect phpMyAdmin, MySQL workbench, or something else to your relational Database in the Cloud to verify connectivity.
- Create a web front end to do the CRUD operations on your Database.
- Feel free to use the same code as others for the front end or create your own. 
- Record a video of you creating, reading, modifying, and deleting database records, and post a working link to your video on Moodle under the project discussion.
- Complete the project feedback assignment on Moodle only after you have completed your project to receive a grade for this project.
